# LocalCloudManager - Rust documentation 5.3.0

This is the new LaTeX documentation edition derived from `Eclipse-Arrowhead-rust/ah5-LocalCloudManager-rust/documentation/v5.2.2`. The complete 5.2.2 folder is retained unchanged.

All top-level `.tex` documents compile to matching 5.3.0 PDFs with `./build-docs.sh` (latexmk, pdfLaTeX and BibTeX). This folder contains its class, figures, bibliography and templates where used. LaTeX is the editable source of record.

The cover/document edition is 5.3.0, dated 2026-11-09. Actual executable/dependency/service and wire-contract versions are retained where the primary code still defines them. This update does not upgrade or deploy implementations. SysDD/IDD documents identify Go and Rust implementation boundaries where applicable.

Maintain this edition here. Historical extraction/generation scripts that write `v5.2.2` must not be run against this edition without an explicit version-aware change. The previous `v5.2.2` edition remains independently usable.
